/*
 This is just a mock of something that is able to get photos from the camera roll.
 Here we will use the standard input/output to create a fake photo instance.
 
 It is important to remeber that we are making I/O here just because it is a mock.
 In a real iOS app you would show an image picker, and that would require to change the application navigaiton state, the UI and so on. Remember: This is just a mock
