## Pull Request Submissions.
Pull Requests should contain the issue you are solving as well as a description about your implementation/solution. Before submitting a pull request, please check that merge issues are resolved.

We use [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce coding rules. The rules can be found in the `.swiftlint.yml` file in the root folder of the project. Please make sure you don't have any warning or error before submitting the Pull Request.

Documentation and tests are very important. When you submit a Pull Request, please keep the documentation updated and Implement the appropriated tests. For instance, if you fix a bug, a good idea is to add tests that are aimed to confirm that the issue has been solved and avoid future regressions.

## Asking Questions
Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/BendingSpoons/katana-swift/issues/new) for any doubt or feature request related to Katana.

For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself (e.g., issus related to Swift), please ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swift) instead. By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.

## Reporting Issues
A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.
We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS you're targeting
* The full output of any stack trace or compiler error
* A code snippet that reproduces the described behavior, if applicable
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
