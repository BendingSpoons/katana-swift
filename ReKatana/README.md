# ReKatana
Redux Library For Katana


### TODO
- Documentation
- Remove duplicated typealiases. They have been added because of [this](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1889) bug
- Improve type system. In particular there are a few places where we check conditions at runtime instead of using the static checker

### TODO from JS Experience
- Analyze how we can automatize edge cases such as text input
- Add tests for performances
- Can we reduce the verbosity? (maybe code generation?)
