 This is an exaple of sync reducer.
 A syncReducer is a special abstraction over reducer that allow you to manage actions that represents sync operations.
 The advantages over the plain standard reducer are:
 1) The action si already casted, you don't need to check whether the action with which the reduer is invoked is the one you want to manage
 
 2) The state is already defined. You don't need to manage optionals
 
 Remember that this kind of reducers, as well as the async counterpart, are meant to be used with ReducerCombiner

/*
 This is a special reducer that combines different reducers for the same state slice.
 The pattern should be that all the reducers are defined as private in the file, and therefore not accesible from other files, and then there is a single reducer that combine all the reducers in a single one.

   Here we combine the reducers.
   The key of the dictionary is the name of the action that will be managed. AddAlbumAction has a special property that allows you to avoid to write the plain string here. In this we avoid problems such as issues after a refactor or misspelling.
   
   The value is the reducer type
