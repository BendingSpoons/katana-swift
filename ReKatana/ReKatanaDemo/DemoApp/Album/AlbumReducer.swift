 This is an exaple of sync reducer.
 A syncReducer is a special abstraction over reducer that allow you to manage actions that represents sync operations.
 The advantages over the plain standard reducer are:
 1) The action si already casted, you don't need to check whether the action with which the reduer is invoked is the one you want to manage
 
 2) The state is already defined. You don't need to manage optionals
 
 Remember that this kind of reducers, as well as the async counterpart, are meant to be used with ReducerCombiner

/*
 This is an async reducer.
 You can use to manage actions related to async operations.
 
 It has 3 (optionals) methods for the 3 possible states of the action: Loading, Completed and Error.
 You can which states you need to manage based on your application needs

 This is a special reducer that combines different reducers for the same state slice.
 The pattern should be that all the reducers are defined as private in the file, and therefore not accesible from other files, and then there is a single reducer that combine all the reducers in a single one.
