/*
 This is a saga, a function where we can add some business logic.
 In this case we will use a provider to take a photo from the camera roll and then send it to the reducer.
 
 We are using a asyncAction so we will receive only the action when it is in the pending state.
 Here is what we will do:
 
 - We will get the action in the pending state, it contains the album name
 - We invoke the camera roll provider, which will return a photo
 - We get the completed action, using the proper method
 - We will dispatch it, the reducer will change the state

  }

/*
 In Swift expression are not allowed at the top level.
 This means that we cannot write instructions in the file itself.
 That being said, SagaModule needs to perform some special operations during addSaga.
 
 As a workaround, we create a function, that performs the module initialization and returns it.
 We then call this function when we create the store.
 
 We should find a better way to handle this
