 This is a real world exaple of how Katana-Redux can be used.
 It mimics the Photo Vault logic, but without the UI and by mocking somethings (e.g., get images from the disk/cameraroll/camera).
 
 The application is CLI based and very minimal. The only purpose here is to test the library in a near-real-world case
