Katana is a modern Swift framework for writing iOS and macOS apps, strongly inspired by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), that gives structure to all the aspects of your app:

- __logic__: the app state is entirely described by a single serializable data structure, and the only way to change the state is to dispatch an action. An action is an intent to transform the state, and contains all the information to do so. Because all the changes are centralized and are happening in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for.
- __UI__: the UI is defined in terms of a tree of components declaratively described by props (the configuration data, i.e. a background color for a button) and state (the internal state data, i.e. the highlighted state for a button). This approach lets you think about components as isolated, reusable pieces of UI, since the way a component is rendered only depends on the current props and state of the component itself.
- __logic__ ↔️ __UI__: the UI components are connected to the app state and will be automatically updated on every state change. You control how they change, selecting the portion of app state that will feed the component props. To render this process as fast as possible, only the relevant portion of the UI is updated. 
- __layout__: Katana defines a concise language (inspired by [Plastic](https://github.com/BendingSpoons/plastic-lib-iOS)) to describe fully responsive layouts that will gracefully scale at every aspect ratio or size, including font sizes and images.


We feel that Katana helped us a lot since we started using it in production. At [Bending Spoons](http://www.bendingspoons.com) we use a lot of open source projects ourselves and we wanted to give something back to the community, hoping you will find this useful and possibly contribute. ❤️

## Overview

### Defining the logic of your app

Your entire app `State` is defined in a single struct, all the relevant application information should be placed here.

```swift
struct CounterState: State {
  var counter: Int = 0
}
```

The app `State` can only be modified by an `Action`. An `Action` represents an event that leads to a change in the `State` of the app. You define the behaviour of the action implementing the `updatedState()` method that will return the new app `State` based on the current app `State` and the `Action` itself.

```swift
struct IncrementCounter: Action {
  func updatedState(currentState: State) -> State {
    guard var state = currentState as? CounterState else { fatalError("wrong state type") 	  }
    state.counter += 1
    return state
  }
}
```

The `Store` contains and manages your entire app `State` and it is responsible for dispatching `Actions` and updating the `State`.

```swift
let store = Store<CounterState>()
store.dispatch(IncrementCounter())
```

You can ask the `Store` to be notified about every change in the app `State`.

```swift
store.addListener() {
  // the app state has changed
}
```



### Defining the UI

In Katana you declaratively describe a specific piece of UI providing a  `NodeDescription`. Each `NodeDescription` will define the component in terms of:

- `StateType` the internal state of the component (es. highlighted for a button)
- `PropsType` the inputs coming from outside the component (es. backgroundColor for a view)
- `NativeView` the UIKit/AppKit element associated with the component

```swift
struct CounterScreen: NodeDescription {
	typealias StateType = EmptyState
	typealias PropsType = CounterScreenProps
	typealias NativeView = UIView
	
	var props: PropsType
}
```

Inside the `props` you want to specify all the inputs needed to render your `NativeView` and to feed your children components.

```swift
struct CounterScreenProps: NodeDescriptionProps {
  var count: Int = 0
  var frame: CGRect = .zero
  var alpha: CGFloat = 1.0
  var key: String?
}
```

When it's time to render the component, the method `applyPropsToNativeView` is called: this is where we need to adjust our nativeView to reflect the  `props` and the `state`. _Note that for common properties like frame, backgroundColor and more we already provide a standard [applyPropsToNativeView](https://github.com/BendingSpoons/katana-swift/blob/master/KatanaElements/View.swift) so we got you covered._

```swift
struct CounterScreen: NodeDescription {
  ...
  public static func applyPropsToNativeView(props: PropsType,
  											state: StateType,
  											view: NativeView, ...) {
  	view.frame = props.frame
  	view.alpha = props.alpha
  }
}
```

`NodeDescriptions` lets you split the UI into small independent, reusable pieces. That's why it is very common for a `NodeDescription` to be composed by other `NodeDescription`s as children, generating the UI tree. To define child components, implement the method `childrenDescriptions`.

```swift
struct CounterScreen: NodeDescription {
  ...
  public static func childrenDescriptions(props: PropsType,
  											state: StateType, ...) -> 	  [AnyNodeDescription] {
  	return [
  		Label(props: LabelProps.build({ (labelProps) in
          labelProps.key = CounterScreen.Keys.label.rawValue
          labelProps.textAlignment = .center
          labelProps.backgroundColor = .mediumAquamarine
          labelProps.text = NSAttributedString(string: "Count: \(props.count)")
      })),
      Button(props: ButtonProps.build({ (buttonProps) in
        buttonProps.key = CounterScreen.Keys.decrementButton.rawValue
        buttonProps.titles[.normal] = "Decrement"
        buttonProps.backgroundColor = .dogwoodRose
        buttonProps.titleColors = [.highlighted : .red]
        
        buttonProps.touchHandlers = [
          .touchUpInside : {
            dispatch(DecrementCounter())
          }
        ]
      })),
      Button(props: ButtonProps.build({ (buttonProps) in
        buttonProps.key = CounterScreen.Keys.incrementButton.rawValue
        buttonProps.titles[.normal] = "Increment"
        buttonProps.backgroundColor = .japaneseIndigo
        buttonProps.titleColors = [.highlighted : .red]
        
        buttonProps.touchHandlers = [
          .touchUpInside : {
            dispatch(IncrementCounter())
          }
        ]
      }))
  	]
  }
}
```



### Attaching the UI to the Logic

The `Renderer` is responsible for rendering the UI tree and updating it when the `Store` changes. 

You create a `Renderer` object starting from the top level `NodeDescription` and the `Store`.

```swift
renderer = Renderer(rootDescription: counterScreen, store: store)
renderer.render(in: view)
```

Every time a new app `State` is available, the `Store` dispatches an event that is captured by the `Renderer ` and dispatched down to the tree of UI components.
If you want a component to receive updates from the `Store` just declare its `NodeDescription` as `ConnectedNodeDescription` and implement the method `connect` to attach the app `Store` to the component `props`.

```swift
struct CounterScreen: ConnectedNodeDescription {
  ...
  static func connect(props: inout PropsType, to storeState: StateType) {
  	props.count = storeState.counter
  }
}
```



### Layout of the UI

Katana has its own language (inspired by [Plastic](https://github.com/BendingSpoons/plastic-lib-iOS)) to programmatically define fully responsive layouts that will gracefully scale at every aspect ratio or size, including font sizes and images.
If you want to opt in, just implement the `PlasticNodeDescription` protocol and its `layout` method where you can define the layout of the children, based on the given `referenceSize`. The layout system will use the reference size to compute the proper scaling. 

```swift
struct CounterScreen: ConnectedNodeDescription, PlasticNodeDescription, PlasticReferenceSizeable {
  ...
  static var referenceSize = CGSize(width: 640, height: 960)
  
  static func layout(views: ViewsContainer<CounterScreen.Keys>, props: PropsType, state: StateType) {
    let nativeView = views.nativeView
    
    let label = views[.label]!
    let decrementButton = views[.decrementButton]!
    let incrementButton = views[.incrementButton]!
    label.asHeader(nativeView)
    [label, decrementButton].fill(top: nativeView.top, bottom: nativeView.bottom)
    incrementButton.top = decrementButton.top
    incrementButton.bottom = decrementButton.bottom
    [decrementButton, incrementButton].fill(left: nativeView.left, right: nativeView.right)
  }
}
```

### Note for layout in macOS

Plastic is assuming that the coordinate system has its origin at the upper left corner of the drawing area (like in iOS), so if you want to use plastic on macOS, remember to specify `isFlipped = true` for all your custom native AppKit views that have children components. All the components we provide are already following this convention.

### Check out the documentation

[Documentation](http://katana.bendingspoons.com)

## Installation

Katana is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), you can also drop `Katana.project` into your Xcode project.

### Requirements

- iOS 8.4+ / macOS 10.10+

- Xcode 8.0+

- Swift 3.0+

  ​

### CocoaPods

 [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Katana into your Xcode project using CocoaPods you need to create a `Podfile`.

For iOS platforms, this is the content

```ruby
use_frameworks!
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.4'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Katana'
  pod 'KatanaElements'
end
```

On MacOS, instead, use the following

```ruby
use_frameworks!
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :osx, '10.11'

target 'test' do
  pod 'Katana'
  pod 'KatanaElements'
end
```

Now, you just need to run:

```bash
$ pod install
```



### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa projects. 
You can install Carthage downloading and running the `Carthage.pkg` file you can download from [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases) or you can install it using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) simply by running:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Katana into your Xcode project using Carthage, add it to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "Bendingspoons/katana-swift"
```

And Run:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Then drag the built `Katana.framework` and `KatanaElements.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Gradual Adoption

You can easily integrate Katana in existing applications. This can be very useful in at least two scenarios:
- You want to try katana in a real world application, but you don't want to rewrite it entirely
- You want to gradually migrate your application to Katana

A gradual adoption doesn't require nothing different from the standard Katana usage. You just need to render your initial `NodeDescription` in the view where you want to place the UI managed by Katana. 

Assuming you are in a view controller and you have a `NodeDescription` named `Description`, you can do something like this:

```swift
// get the view where you want to render the UI managed by Katana
let view = methodToGetView()
let description = Description(props: Props.build {
	$0.frame = view.frame
})

// here we are not using the store. But you can create it normally
// You should also retain a reference to renderer, in order to don't deallocate all the UI that will be created when the method ends
let renderer = Renderer(rootDescription: description, store: nil)

// render the UI
renderer!.render(in: view)
```
