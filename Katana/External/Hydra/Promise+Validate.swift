	/// This operator allows you to validate the result of `self` promise.
	/// It exposes a block where you can return `true` or `false` (or `throw`).
	/// If validation returns `true` promise is validated and the result is propagated over.
	/// If validation returns `false` (or `throws`) promise is rejected and the error is propagated over.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - context: context in which the validate is executed (if not specified `background` is used)
	///   - validate: validate block
	/// - Returns: promise
