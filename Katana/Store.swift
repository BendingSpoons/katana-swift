/**
 The `Store` is a sort of single entry point that handles the logic of your application.
 In Katana, all the various pieces of information that your application manages should be stored
 in a single atom, called state (see also `State` protocol).

 The `Store`, however, doesn't really implements any application specific logic: this class
 only manages operations that are requested by the application-specific logic. In particular,
 you can require the `Store` to execute something by `dispatching a dispatchable item`.

 Currently the store handles 2 types of dispatchable: `State Updater`, `Side Effect`

 #### Update the state
 As written before, in Katana every relevant information in the application should be stored in the
 Store's state. The only way to update the state is to dispatch a `StateUpdater`.
 At this point the `Store` will execute the following operations:

 - it executes the interceptors
 - it creates the new state, by invoking the `updateState` function of the `StateUpdater`
 - it updates the state
 - it resolves the promise

 #### Handle to Business Logic
 Non trivial applications require to interact with external services and/or implement complex logics.
 The proper way to handle these is by dispatching a `SideEffect`.
 The `Store` will execute the following operations:

 - it executes the interceptors
 - it executes the `SideEffect` body
 - it resolves the promise

 #### Listen for updates
 You can attach a listener that is invoked every time the state changes by using `addListener`.

 #### Intercept Dispatchable
 It is possible to intercept and reshape the behaviour of the `Store` by using a `StoreInterceptor`.
 A `StoreInterceptor` is executed every time something has dispatched, and before it is actually
 managed by the `Store`. Here you implement behaviours like logging, blocking items before they're executed
 and even change dynamically which dispatchable items arrive to the `Store` itself.

 - seeAlso: `StateUpdater` for more information about how to implement an update of the state
 - seeAlso: `SideEffect` for more information about how to implement a complex/asynchronous logic

   #### Initial phases
   When the store is created, it doesn't immediately start to handle dispatched items.
   Before that, in fact, the `Store` will (in order)
   * create the dependencies
   * create the first state version by using the given `stateInitializer`
   * initialise the interceptors

   Accessing the state before the `Store` is ready will lead to a crash of the application, as the
   state of the system is not well defined. You can check whether the `Store` is ready by leveraging the `isReady` property.
   
   A good practice in case you have to interact with the `Store` (e.g., get the state) in the initial phases of your
   application is to dispatch a `SideEffect`. When dispatching something, in fact, the `Store` guarantees that
   items are managed only after that the `Store` is ready. Items dispatched during the initialization are suspended
   and resumed as soon as the `Store` is ready.

   The `Store` follows strict rules about the parallelism with which dispatched items are handled.
   At the same time, it tries to leverages as much as possible the modern multi-core systems that our
   devices offer.

   When a `ReturningSideEffect` is dispatched, Katana will handle them in a parallel queue. A `ReturningSideEffect` is executed and considered
   done when its body finishes to be executed. This means that side effects are not guaranteed to be run in isolation, and you
   should take into account the fact that multiple side effects can run at the same time. This decision has been taken to greatly
   improve the performances of the system. Overall, this should not be a problem as you cannot really change
   the state of the system (that is, the store's state) without dispatching a `ReturningSideEffect`.

   #### Promise Resolution

   When it comes to `ReturningSideEffect`s, the promise is resolved when the body of the `ReturningSideEffect` is executed entirely (see
