/**
 The `Store` is a sort of single entry point that handles the logic of your application.
 In Katana, all the various pieces of information that your application manages should be stored
 in a single atom, called state (see also `State` protocol).
 
 The `Store`, however, doesn't really implements any application specific logic: this class
 only manages operations that are requsted by the application-specific logic. In particular,
 you can require the `Store` to execute something by `dispatching a dispatchable item`.

 Currently the store handles 3 types of dispatchable: `State Updater`, `Side Effect` and (deprecated) `Action`.
 
 #### Update the state
 As written before, in Katana every relevant information in the application should be stored in the
 Store's state. The only way to update the state is to dispatch a `StateUpdater` (or the legacy `Action`).
 At this point the `Store` will execute the following operations:
 
 - it executes the interceptors
 - it creates the new state, by invoking the `updateState` function of the `StateUpdater`
 - it updates the state
 - it resolves the promise
 
 #### Handle to Business Logic
 Non trivial applications require to interact with external services and/or implement complex logics.
 The proper way to handle these is by dispatching a `SideEffect`.
 The `Store` will execute the following operations:
 
 - it executes the interceptors
 - it executes the `SideEffect` body
 - it resolves the promise
 
 #### Listen for updates
 You can attach a listener that is invoked every time the state changes by using `addListener`.
 
 #### Intercept Dispatchable
 It is possible to intercept and reshape the behaviour of the `Store` by using a `StoreInterceptor`.
 A `StoreInterceptor` is executed every time something has dispatched, and before it is actually
 managed by the `Store`. Here you implement behaviours like logging, blocking items before they're executed
 and even change dynamically which dispatchable items arrive to the `Store` itself.
 
 - seeAlso: `StateUpdater` for more information about how to implement an update of the state
 - seeAlso: `SideEffect` for more information about how to implement an complex/asyncronous logic

   #### Initial phases
   When the store is created, it doesn't immediately start to handle dispatched items.
   Before that, in fact, the `Store` will (in order)
   * create the dependencies
   * create the first state version by using the given `stateInitializer`
   * initialise the interceptors

   Accessing the state before the `Store` is ready will lead to a crash of the application, as the
   state of the system is not well defined. You can check whether the `Store` is ready by leveraging the `isReady` property.
   
   A good pratice in case you have to interact with the `Store` (e.g., get the state) in the initial phases of your
   application is to dispatch a `SideEffect`. When dispatching something, in fact, the `Store` guarantees that
   items are managed only after that the `Store` is ready. Items dispatched during the initialization are suspended
   and resumed as soon as the `Store` is ready.

  /**
   Dispatches a `Dispatchable` item
   
   #### Threading
   
   The `Store` follows strict rules about the parallelism with which dispatched items are handled.
   At the sime time, it tries to leverages as much as possible the modern multi-core systems that our
   devices offer.
   
   When a `StateUpdater` is dispatched, the Store enqueues it in a serial and syncronous queue. This means that the Store
   executes one update of the state at the time, following the order in which it has received them. This is done
   to guarantee the predictability of the changes to the state and avoid any race condition. In general, using a syncronous
   queue is never a big problem as any operation that goes in a `StateUpdater` is very lighweight.
   
   When it comes to `SideEffect` items, Katana will handle them in a parallel queue. A `SideEffect` is executed and considered
   done when its body finishes to be executed. This menas that side effects are not guaranteed to be run in isolation, and you
   should take into account the fact that multiple side effects can run at the same time. This decision has been taken to greately
   improve the performances of the system. Overall, this should not be a problem as you cannot really change
   the state of the system (that is, the store's state) without dispatching a `StateUpdater`.
   
   This version of the store keeps the support for `Action` items. Since actions both update the state and executes side effects,
   they are managed in the very same, serial and syncronous, queue of the `StateUpdater`. You are encouraged to move away from
   actions as soon as possible.
   
   #### Promise Resolution
   
   When it comes to `StateUpdater`, the promise is resolved when the state is updated. For `SideEffect`,
   the promise is resolved when the body of the `SideEffect` is executed entirely (see `SideEffect` documentation for
   more information). For `Action`, finally, the promise is resolved when the state is updated and the sideEffect method
   is executed (note that this doesn't mean that the side effect is effectively done, as there's no simple mechanism to
   block the execution of a sideeffect in an action)
