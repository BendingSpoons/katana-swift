 A `StateUpdater` is a `Dispatchable` that can be used to update the `Store`
 state configuration.
 
 The `StateUpdater` is strongly tied to the state that it handles. This greatily simplifies
 the code written in normal situations. However, if you need to create updaters that are not strictly
 tied to a concrete state type (e.g., in a library) you can use `AnyStateUpdater`.
