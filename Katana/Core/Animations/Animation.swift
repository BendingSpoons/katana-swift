/**
 The animation for a child of a `NodeDescription`.
 
 The idea is that, for elements that are either created or destroyed during an animation,
 we will compute initial or final state and then animate to/from there.
 
 When an element is created during an animated update, we take the final state (that is, the state
 you have returned in the `childrenDescription` method) and we apply the transformers
 you have specified in `entryTransformers`.
 The resulting props are used to render an intermediated state that will be animated to the final state.
 
 When an element is destroyed during an animated update, something similar happens. The only difference is that
 we take the initial state (that is, the state of the last render when the element was present) and we apply the
 transformers you have specified in `leaveTransformers`
