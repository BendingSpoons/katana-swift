/**
 Node Descriptions can implement this protocol to provide a way to access to imperative behaviours.
 
 There are two cases where this could be leveraged:
 - updating the state/storage too often leads to performance issues. Refs could be used
   to temporary skip the classic update cycle and improve the performances
 
 - trigger imperative behaviours which would be hard/weird to implement with a declarative approach.
   For instance, "dismiss/show keyboard" is a good example of imperative behaviour
 
 In general refs, should be used as last resort. Declarative way is more appropriated in Katana and
 in it is safer.

/**
 Protocol for refs.
 
 A ref is nothing more that a proxy to the native view.
 It is used for two reasons:
  - limit the exposed properties/methods
  - avoid retain cycles
 
 The second reason also requires a special attention during the implementation.
 
 In particular, the idea is that the ref should contain a weak reference to the native view.
 The init should be therefore implemented in the following way:
 
 ```swift
 init(nativeView: NativeTextField) {
  weak var s: NativeViewType? = nativeView
  self.nativeView = s
 }
 ```
 
 where `nativeView` is a weak variable
 
 ```swift
 private weak var nativeView: NativeViewType?
 ```
 
 Failing in implement the ref in the proper way could lead to wrong behaviours, memory leaks and so on.
