 Protocol that represents an `async` action.
 
 An `AsyncAction` is just an abstraction over `Action` that provides a way to structure
 your action.
 
 You typically use an `Async` action when you have to deal with operations that are asynchronous.
 In the most common scenario, you dispatch the initial action, execute an operation in the side effect 
 and then dispatch a completed/failed action based on the result of the operation.
 
 This protocol offers two main advantages:

 * The way in which the action payloads are defined is enforced. We introduced this pattern to
   allow future automatic behaviours such as automatic serialization/deserialization of the actions
   (that can be used for debugging, time travel and so on)
 
 * Convenient separation of the updateStae function based on the state of the action
   (`updatedStateForLoading(currentState: action:)`, `updatedStateForCompleted(currentState: action:)`
    and `updatedStateForFailed(currentState: action:)`)
 
 It is important to note that this is just a a convenience approach to something you can do anyway.
 You can for instance create three actions: `performOperation`, `OperationCompleted` and `OperationFailed` and achieve
 the same result. `AsyncAction` just provide a way to abstract and simplify the process
 
 #### Tip & Tricks
 Since the `Action` protocol is very generic when it comes to the state type that should be updated, a pattern
 we want to promote is to put in your application a protocol like the following:
 
 ```
 protocol AppSyncAction: AsyncAction {
  func updatedStateForLoading(currentState: inout AppState)
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 
 extension AppSyncAction {
  func updatedStateForLoading(currentState: State) -> State {
    guard var state = state as? AppState else {
      fatalError("Something went wrong")
    }
 
    self.updatedStateForLoading(currentState: &state)
    return state
  }
 
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 ```
 
 In this way you can save a lot of code since you can use your actions in the following way
 
 ```
 struct A: AppAsyncAction {
  func updatedStateForLoading(currentState: inout AppState) {
    state.props = action.payload
  }
 
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 ```
