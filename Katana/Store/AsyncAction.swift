 Protocol that represents an `async` action.
 
 An `AsyncAction` is just an abstraction over `Action` that provides a way to structure
 your action.
 
 You typically use an `Async` action when you have to deal with operations that are asynchronous.
 In the most common scenario, you dispatch the initial action, execute an operation in the side effect 
 and then dispatch a completed/failed action based on the result of the operation.
 
 This protocol offers two mainly advantages:

 * The way in which the action payloads are defined is enforced. We introduced this pattern to
   allow future automatic behaviours such as automatic serialization/deserialization of the actions
   (that can be used for debugging, time travel and so on)
 
 * Convenient separation of the reduce function based on the state of the action
   (`loadingReduce(state: action:)`, `completedReduce(state: action:)` and `failedReduce(state: action:)`)
 
 It is important to note that this is just a a convenience approach to something you can do anyway.
 You can for instance create three actions: `performOperation`, `OperationCompleted` and `OperationFailed` and achieve
 the same result. `AsyncAction` just provide a way to abstract and simplify the process
 
 #### Tip & Tricks
 Since the `Action` protocol is very generic when it comes to the state type that should be reduced, a pattern
 we want to promote is to put in your application a protocol like the following:
 
 ```
 protocol AppSyncAction: AsyncAction {
  static func loadingReduce(state: inout AppState, action: AddTodo)
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 
 extension AppSyncAction {
  static func loadingReduce(state: State, action: AddTodo) -> State {
    guard var state = state as? AppState else {
      fatalError("Something went wrong")
    }
 
    self.loadingReduce(state: &state, action: action)
    return state
  }
 
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 ```
 
 In this way you can save a lot of code since you can use your actions in the following way
 
 ```
 struct A: AppAsyncAction {
  static func loadingReduce(state: inout AppState, action: AddTodo) {
    state.props = action.payload
  }
 
  // same for completed and failed
 }
 ```

  associatedtype LoadingPayload
  
  /// The type of payload when the state is `completed`
  associatedtype CompletedPayload
  
  /// The type of payload when the state is `failed`

  /// The state of the action

  var loadingPayload: LoadingPayload { get set }
  
  /// The completed payload of the action. It has a value only when the state is `completed`
  var completedPayload: CompletedPayload? { get set }
  
  /// The failed payload of the action. It has a value only when the state is `failed`
  var failedPayload: FailedPayload? { get set }
