/**
 A side effect is a single atom of the logic of your application.
 While you can actually use them as you desire, the idea is to implement in each side effect
 a meaningful, self contained, piece of logic that can be used from other pieces of you application
 (e.g., dispatched by a View Controller or by another side effect).
 
 The `StateUpdater` is strongly tied to the state that it handles and the dependencies it has.
 This greatily simplifies the code written in normal situations.
 However, if you need to create updaters that are not strictly tied to a concrete types (e.g., in a library)
 you can use `AnySideEffect`.
 
 ### App Tips & Tricks
To further simplify the usage of a `StateUpdater` you can add to your application a helper protocol
 ```swift
 /// assuming `AppState` is the type of your application's state and `DependenciesContainer` is the
 /// container of your dependencies
 protocol AppSideEffect: SideEffect where StateType == AppState, Dependencies == DependenciesContainer {}
 ```
 
 By conforming to `AppSideEffect`, you will get better autocompletion
*/
public protocol SideEffect: AnySideEffect {
  /// The type of the state of the store
  associatedtype StateType: State
  
  /// The type of the dependencies container that is used to pass dependencies to the side effect
  associatedtype Dependencies: SideEffectDependencyContainer

  /**
   Block that implements the logic of the side effect.
   You can implement the logic, leveraging the technology you desire for threading and flow management.
   
   However, there are two patterns that Katana suggests to use: synchronous side effects and asynchronous side effects
   
   #### Syncronous
   A synchronous side effect is a side effect that finishes its execution when the `sideEffect(:)` method
   is completed. Since the related promise (that is, the promise that is returned when the side effect is dispatched)
   is resolved when this method ends, it means that the caller can safely assume that the operations are completed.
   
   The easier way to achieve this behaviour is by using `await` offered by the `Hydra` library. You can use `await`
   with any API that returns a promise (e.g., the dispatch) and it blocks the execution of the method until the
   promise is resolved (you can find more documentation here https://github.com/malcommac/Hydra/#awaitasync).
   
   This should be the default approach you take for your side effects
   
   #### Asynchronous
   An asynchronous side effect is a side effect that continues to propagate its effect even after the `sideEffect(:)` method
   has been completed. This can be very helpful for very long running operations where you don't want to block
   other side effects in the queue.
   
   In order to do use this approach, you can simply apply any asynchronous technique you know that does not block the method
   (e.g.: promise, callback).
   
   This approach is not suggested and should be used only in rare cases
   
   - parameter context: the context of the side effect
   - throws: if the logic has an error. The related promise will be rejected
   - seeAlso: https://github.com/malcommac/Hydra/#awaitasync

public extension SideEffect {

    guard let typedSideEffect = context as? SideEffectContext<StateType, Dependencies> else {
